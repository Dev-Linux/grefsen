touch window drag/resize
long-press menu
dbus menubar & tray
xwayland: root window transparent, or under the grefsen desktop background? or rootless?
probably hard: decorate X windows (like Weston does)
xdg_shell protocol (weston and gtk apps don't run without it)
device hotplugging?

to fix
------
connman configuration - can't always turn technologies on and off
the crash when killing applications via the titlebar close button
click outside popups to close
can't run grefsen inside grefsen (or is it impossible?)

done
----
basic sidebar with a basic launcher for konsole
some custom window decorations
launcher menu based on desktop files
launchers for more apps: qtcreator and a browser at least
-c for config
clock and calendar
