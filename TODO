-c for config; test nested
touch window drag/resize
long-press menu
dbus menubar & tray
xwayland: root window transparent, or under the grefsen desktop background? or rootless?
probably hard: decorate X windows (like Weston does)
xdg_shell protocol (weston apps don't run without it)

to fix
------
connman configuration
the crash
click outside popups to close

done
----
basic sidebar with a basic launcher for konsole
some custom window decorations
launcher menu based on desktop files
launchers for more apps: qtcreator and a browser at least
